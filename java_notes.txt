25 : What is arraylist and differences between Arraylist and arrays

Arraylist = we can dynamically grow the size of array
new operator will allocate memory 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\coreJavaBrushup2.java

26: Iterating over array and arraylists and its related methods 
array means length
arraylist means size 
we can convert array to array list 
array - static size 
array_list  - dynamic size 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\coreJavaBrushup2.java

27.Strings in Java - How to declare strings and important string methods 
string is an object in java 
String is an object that represents sequence of characters 
string literal or new object 
String a = "Raghavendra automation"
String a1 = "Raghavendra automation"
same reference here 
String abc = new String("Welcome");
String abc2 = new String("Welcome" )

2 types of declaration :
literal 
and using new keyword 

new creates new object in memory space
literal it refers to the same object 

printing string in reverse
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\coreJavaBrushup3Strings.java

28.How to create methods and access methods using Java class objects 
Set of lines which we will repeatedly call 
Method should be written outside main block 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\MethodsDemo.java

static will move method to class level 
from public 
Method cannot be created inside main block 
Method is like functions in python.

282 : while loop :
while (boolean){
}
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\whileDemo.java

283 : do while loop 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\whileDemo.java

do executes first and then evaluates 
1 loop execution is guaranteed

289:Interface :
Interface will have methods , but not body 
Classes should define and implement methods present in interface

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\CentralTraffic.java
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\AustralianTraffic.java

290 : How java classes take advantage of interfaces 
one class can implement more interfaces :
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\ContinentalTraffic.java

292. what are abstract classes ? how it is different from interfaces ?
abstraction : hiding implementation details from user 
only functionality will be provided to user .
in other words , user will have the information on what object does instead of how it does it 

Abstract classes and methods : 
Class which is declared with abstract keyword is known as abstract class in java 

it can have abstract (method without the body) and non abstract methods (method with the body)

Abstraction classes achieve partial abstraction .

Interfaces on the other had are used for 100% abstraction 




Real life example :
Ther is a parent class which defined aircraft body construction rules 

All child classes ( different aircraft companies ) have to inherit parent class and use those 
methods to build their own aircraft

but there is a method called aircraft colour which can be unique to every child  class depending on company logo 

so color method in parent class is not implemented with any body .Instead only method is defined without any body which is called abstract method

if there is any method in a class which is abstact . then the class will be treated as abstract class

unlike interfaces , the abstract class can have methods (concrete) which have implementation as well , So with abstract class only partial abstarction is achieved 

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\ChildEmirates.java
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\ParentAircraft.java

you cannot instantiate object for abstract class 

ParentAircraft b = new ParentAircraft();
it cannot be created 

*****Interview*****

Interface : 
1.Interface contains only abstract methods
2.Access specifiers for methods in interface must be public 
3.variables defined must be public , static , final 
4.To implement an interface we use implements keyword

Abstract class : 
1.Abstract class can contain abstarct methods, concrete methods or both 
2.Except private we can have any access specifier for methods in abstract class
3.Except private variables can have any access specifiers 
4.To implement an abstract we use extends keyword 

293. Inheritance in Java 
vehicle example 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\oopsCoreJava\parentClass.java
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\oopsCoreJava\childClass.java

294. Practical example on typs of inheritance .

Mulitple inheritances are not allowed in java
interface it is allowed - whereas multiple interface is allowed 
class X 
{
//Class X members
}

class Y 
{
//Class Y members 
}

class Z extends X,Y
{
//class Z members 
}


class A 
{
int i = 10
}

class B extends A {
int i = 20 
}

public class main class {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
	{
		A a = new B()
		webdriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
		System.out.println(a.i)
	}
}

296: Function /Method overloading 
-either argument count should be different
-either argument data type should be different

java .util package 

Date d = new Date();
//System.out.println(d.toString());
		
		SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("MMM/DD/YYYY");

307: calender objects in java 

308.Constructor 
C:\RD\Trainings\gitrepos\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\ConstructDemo.java

Whenever a object is created a block of code is executed .
called constructor 
--will not return any value
--it should be always class name only 
--compliler will call default /implicit construtor 
--if we define it will call explicit construtor 

309. Types of constructor .
Parameterized constructor 

C:\RD\Trainings\gitrepos\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\ConstructDemo.java

311. Super keyword 
C:\RD\Trainings\gitrepos\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\childSuperDemo.java
C:\RD\Trainings\gitrepos\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\ParentSuperDemo.java

super refers to parent class 

312 . Super keyword practical usage 
//common method between parent and child 
how to handle it 
super should be the first line in constuctor.

313. This keyword 

C:\RD\Trainings\gitrepos\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\ThisKeywordDemo.java
this scope is at class level , not method level 
you should write step by step code and understand .
this refers to global variable 
not the variable present in our local methods 
No parent child concept in this keyword 


314 : Static and non static importance in java 

Instance varialbles ?
local variables ?
class variables ?
static keyword
static method and static variable 
static block 

C:\RD\Trainings\gitrepos\javaselenium\src\variablesRelated\StaticVar.java

objects need to be created to access varaibles and methods of same class as well 

creating object and creating instance both are same 

instance variable no sharing 

static methods will only accept static variables 
we can call static method with class name and not object name .

315 : Final keyword 
C:\RD\Trainings\gitrepos\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\FinalDemo.java

final means constant variable 
no one can change 

even class and method can be final 
class marked as final cannot be extended .

public class test 
final class test 

final methods cannot be overridden

final/pubic void testmethod 



316 : packages and their usage in oops
set of classes and interfaces 
java.lang - Default - comes with java compiler inbuilt 
(int , array etc ) 



java.util.ArrayList 
java.util.Hashset
import corejava.arraydemo

317 . Types of packages and how they will help in realtime 

Class A can use Class B directly by creating object if both class A and B belongs to same package.
import package.classname 

318. Access modifiers
=======
###################3- Mar #################
318.Importance of access modifiers 

--public 
--private
--protected 
--default 

//Default - access method anywhere in  package- eventhogh we import it as package. we cannot access it outside package 
//public - we can access across package or anywhere 


319. Private and protected .

//private : you cannot access method or varaiable outside class 
//protected - only subclasses can access 

public
--protected(subclasses)
--default(same package)
--private (same class)

320. Diff kind of exceptions 

lines of code will throw an error not 
try catch 

divide by zero 

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\exceptionDemo.java

321 : mechanism to handle exceptions 
//one try can be followed by mutliple catch blocks 
//catch should be immediately after try block
//arithmetic exception 

322. Importanc of finally block in java 
finally : this block executed irrespective of exception thrown or not 

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\exceptionDemo.java

even without catch it will get executed 
we can use it to close browser 

finally will not get executed when we stop jvm


324  : java collections 
java collection framework is a collection of classes and interfaces 
which helps in storing and processing data efficiently

This framework has several useful classees which have tons of useful functions
which makes a programmer tasks super easy 

List :, Set , Map 
is an ordered collection.
it can contain duplicate elements
below are classes implementing list interface 

-array list 
-linked list 
-vector 

325: Array List 

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\ArrayListExample.java
java.util 
array -fixed size 
array list - can grow dynamically 

328 : Hashset 

Set : 
//hashset, treeset, linked set
//set will not accept duplicate values 
//elements will be sequently stored 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\HashsetExample.java

329 : Hashset using iterator 
HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<String>();
Iterator<String> it= hs.iterator();

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\HashsetExample.java

330. Implemtation of Map Interface : 
map 
key value pair  
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\HashMapDemo.java

we can convert it into set using entryset method

Not clear 

331. Diff between hashmap and hashtable 
hashmap is not syncrhonized and is not threadsafe.hashtable is syncronized and threadsafe 
hashmap allows nullkeys .
hashmap - iterator
hashtable - enumerator 


332.Printing unique number - amazon interview questions
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\collectionDemo.java


333.Interview Questions :

What are the core concepts of OOPS?
OOPS core concepts are;

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Composition
Association
Aggregation
What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is an OOPS concept to construct the structure of the real world objects. During this construction only the general states and behaviors are taken and more specific states and behaviors are left aside for the implementers.

What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is an OOPS concept to create and define the permissions and restrictions of an object and its member variables and methods. A very simple example to explain the concept is to make the member variables of a class private and providing public getter and setter methods. Java provides four types of access level modifiers: public, protected, no modifier and private.

What is the difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation?
“Program to interfaces, not implementations” is the principle for Abstraction and “Encapsulate what varies” is the OO principle for Encapsulation.
Abstraction provides a general structure of a class and leaves the details for the implementers. Encapsulation is to create and define the permissions and restrictions of an object and its member variables and methods.
Abstraction is implemented in Java using interface and abstract class while Encapsulation is implemented using four types of access level modifiers: public, protected, no modifier and private.


What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the occurrence of something in various forms. Java supports various forms of polymorphism like polymorphic reference variables, polymorphic method, polymorphic return types and polymorphic argument types.

What is Inheritance?
A subclass can inherit the states and behaviors of it’s super class is known as inheritance.

What is multiple inheritance?
A child class inheriting states and behaviors from multiple parent classes is known as multiple inheritance.

What is the diamond problem in inheritance?
In case of multiple inheritance, suppose class A has two subclasses B and C, and a class D has two super classes B and C.If a method present in A is overridden by both B and C but not by D then from which class D will inherit that method B or C? This problem is known as diamond problem.

Why Java does not support multiple inheritance?
Java was designed to be a simple language and multiple inheritance introduces complexities like diamond problem. Inheriting states or behaviors from two different type of classes is a case which in reality very rare and it can be achieved easily through an object association.

What is Static Binding and Dynamic Binding?
Static or early binding is resolved at compile time. Method overloading is an example of static binding.

Dynamic or late or virtual binding is resolved at run time. Method overriding is an example of dynamic binding.

What is a Class?
A class is the specification or template of an object.

What is an Object?
Object is instance of class.


336:
Java interview questions
What is Runtime Polymorphism?
Runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time.

In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a super class. The 

 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?
Abstraction hides the implementation details whereas encapsulation wraps code and data into a single unit.



 What is abstract class?
A class that is declared as abstract is known as abstract class. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

 Can there be any abstract method without abstract class?
No, if there is any abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.

Can you use abstract and final both with a method?
No, because abstract method needs to be overridden whereas you can't override final method.

Is it possible to instantiate the abstract class?
No, abstract class can never be instantiated.

What is interface?

Interface is a blueprint of a class that have static constants and abstract methods.It can be used to achieve fully abstraction and multiple inheritance.



 Can you declare an interface method static?

No, because methods of an interface is abstract by default, and static and abstract keywords can't be used together.

 Can an Interface be final?
No, because its implementation is provided by another class.

 What is marker interface?
An interface that have no data member and method is known as a marker interface.For example Serializable, Cloneable etc.

 What is difference between abstract class and interface?
Abstract class	Interface
1)An abstract class can have method body (non-abstract methods).	Interface have only abstract methods.
2)An abstract class can have instance variables.	An interface cannot have instance variables.
3)An abstract class can have constructor.	Interface cannot have constructor.
4)An abstract class can have static methods.	Interface cannot have static methods.
5)You can extends one abstract class.	You can implement multiple interfaces.
 Can we define private and protected modifiers for variables in interfaces?
No, they are implicitly public.

 When can an object reference be cast to an interface reference?
An object reference can be cast to an interface reference when the object implements the referenced interface.
