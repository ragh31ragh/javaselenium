	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int num = 5 ;
		String website = "raghavendra test" ;
		char letter = 'r';

23.Enhanced for loop declaration and using conditional statements inside the loops

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\coreJavaBrushup2.java

25 : What is arraylist and differences between Arraylist and arrays

Arraylist = we can dynamically grow the size of array
new operator will allocate memory 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\coreJavaBrushup2.java

26: Iterating over array and arraylists and its related methods 
array means length
arraylist means size 
we can convert array to array list 
array - static size 
array_list  - dynamic size 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\coreJavaBrushup2.java

27.Strings in Java - How to declare strings and important string methods 
string is an object in java 
String is an object that represents sequence of characters 
string literal or new object 
String a = "Raghavendra automation"
String a1 = "Raghavendra automation"
same reference here 
String abc = new String("Welcome");
String abc2 = new String("Welcome" )

2 types of declaration :
literal 
and using new keyword 

new creates new object in memory space
literal it refers to the same object 

printing string in reverse
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\coreJavaBrushup3Strings.java

28.How to create methods and access methods using Java class objects 
Set of lines which we will repeatedly call 
Method should be written outside main block 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\MethodsDemo.java

static will move method to class level 
from public 
Method cannot be created inside main block 
Method is like functions in python.

282 : while loop :
while (boolean){
}
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\whileDemo.java

283 : do while loop 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\coreJavaLearningtwofive\whileDemo.java

do executes first and then evaluates 
1 loop execution is guaranteed 

285 :Nested loops

		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int k = 1 ;
		for ( int i = 0; i < 4 ;i++) {
			//System.out.println("Outer loop started ");

			for (int j = 1 ; j <=  4-i ; j++ ) {
				//System.out.println("Inner loop ");
				System.out.print(k);
				System.out.print("\t");
				k++ ;
		}
			System.out.println("");
		}

289:Interface :
Interface will have methods , but not body 
Classes should define and implement methods present in interface

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\CentralTraffic.java
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\AustralianTraffic.java

290 : How java classes take advantage of interfaces 
one class can implement more interfaces :
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\ContinentalTraffic.java

292. what are abstract classes ? how it is different from interfaces ?
abstraction : hiding implementation details from user 
only functionality will be provided to user .
in other words , user will have the information on what object does instead of how it does it 

Abstract classes and methods : 
Class which is declared with abstract keyword is known as abstract class in java 

it can have abstract (method without the body) and non abstract methods (method with the body)

Abstraction classes achieve partial abstraction .

Interfaces on the other had are used for 100% abstraction 




Real life example :
Ther is a parent class which defined aircraft body construction rules 

All child classes ( different aircraft companies ) have to inherit parent class and use those 
methods to build their own aircraft

but there is a method called aircraft colour which can be unique to every child  class depending on company logo 

so color method in parent class is not implemented with any body .Instead only method is defined without any body which is called abstract method

if there is any method in a class which is abstact . then the class will be treated as abstract class

unlike interfaces , the abstract class can have methods (concrete) which have implementation as well , So with abstract class only partial abstarction is achieved 

I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\ChildEmirates.java
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\demoPack\ParentAircraft.java

you cannot instantiate object for abstract class 

ParentAircraft b = new ParentAircraft();
it cannot be created 

*****Interview*****

Interface : 
1.Interface contains only abstract methods
2.Access specifiers for methods in interface must be public 
3.variables defined must be public , static , final 
4.To implement an interface we use implements keyword

Abstract class : 
1.Abstract class can contain abstarct methods, concrete methods or both 
2.Except private we can have any access specifier for methods in abstract class
3.Except private variables can have any access specifiers 
4.To implement an abstract we use extends keyword 

293. Inheritance in Java 
vehicle example 
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\oopsCoreJava\parentClass.java
I:\Learnings\Raghavendra\gitdemo\javaselenium\src\oopsCoreJava\childClass.java

294. Practical example on typs of inheritance .

Mulitple inheritances are not allowed in java
interface it is allowed 
class X 
{
//Class X members
}

class Y 
{
//Class Y members 
}

class Z extends X,Y
{
//class Z members 
}


class A 
{
int i = 10
}

class B extends A {
int i = 20 
}

public class main class {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
	{
		A a = new B()
		webdriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
		System.out.println(a.i)
	}
}

296: Function overloading 
-either argument count should be different
-either argument data type should be different

*****Interview*****


Tool and Technology Selection

Challenge: Choosing the right tools and libraries for test automation, especially with evolving technologies.

Solution: Conducted a proof of concept (POC) to evaluate tools like Selenium, Appium, or Cypress, based on project requirements, team skill set, and project tech stack.

2. Scalability and Maintenance

Challenge: Ensuring the framework scales with increasing test cases and is easy to maintain.

Solution: Adopted modular architecture with reusable components, such as Page Object Model (POM) and utility classes. Used design patterns like Singleton for WebDriver management.

3. Integration with CI/CD

Challenge: Integrating the framework with CI/CD pipelines to enable continuous testing.

Solution: Configured tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps to trigger tests automatically on every code change, and set up email/slack notifications for test results.

4. Dynamic Web Elements

Challenge: Handling elements with dynamic attributes or frequently changing locators.

Solution: Used advanced locator strategies like XPath axes, CSS selectors, and relative locators. Introduced robust wait mechanisms (explicit and fluent waits) to avoid timing issues.

5. Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Testing

Challenge: Ensuring tests work seamlessly across different browsers and platforms.

Solution: Integrated cross-browser testing tools like Selenium Grid or cloud solutions (e.g., BrowserStack, Sauce Labs). Designed test data and configurations to run on various environments.

6. Test Data Management

Challenge: Managing test data for different environments and scenarios.

Solution: Centralized test data in files (e.g., JSON, Excel) or databases. Used tools like Apache POI for Excel and ensured data-driven tests with TestNG’s @DataProvider or JUnit’s parameterized tests.

7. Error Handling and Reporting

Challenge: Identifying flaky tests and understanding test failures effectively.

Solution: Implemented retry logic for flaky tests using RetryAnalyzer in TestNG. Used reporting tools like Allure, Extent Reports, or Serenity for detailed reporting with screenshots, logs, and test execution steps.

8. Team Collaboration

Challenge: Aligning diverse team members on framework standards and practices.

Solution: Documented framework structure, coding standards, and best practices. Conducted training sessions and regular code reviews to ensure consistency.

9. Execution Speed

Challenge: Long test execution times for large test suites.

Solution: Parallelized test execution using TestNG/JUnit and Selenium Grid. Prioritized tests based on impact and executed critical tests first.

10. Adapting to New Requirements

Challenge: Updating the framework to support new features or technologies.

Solution: Designed the framework to be modular and extensible, enabling smooth addition of new features without disrupting the existing structure.
