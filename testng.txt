TestNG- Test New Generation
java based unit testing tool

Advantages :
----------
1.Test cases and test suites 
2.Grouping of test cases 
3.Prioritize
4.Parameterize
5.Parallel testing 
6.Reports 

TestNG configuration :
-----------------------
1.Install testng in eclipse
2.add testng library to build path /add testng dependency in pom.xml 

@Test Annotation 

1.TestNG executes test cases in alphabetical order 
2.@Test(priority=num) controls the order of execution 
3.Once you provide priority to the test methods , then order of method is not considered
4.Priority can be random numbers( consecutive numbers are not required)
5.Default priority is 0 
6.Negative values are also allowed for priority 
7.Only if @Test annotation is present test will get executed 

methods name 
we can use include and exclude tags 
use regular expressions to include or exclude tcs * 
@Test(groups={"Smoke"}

<groups>
  			<run>
  				<include name = "Smoke"></include>
  			</run>
  		</groups>

Before and After Class
Before and After Method 

@Test(dependsOnMethods={"WebLoginCarLoan"})
@Test(dependsOnMethods={"WebLoginCarLoan","AddoneMore"})


TestNG will skip the testcase.
Incase we have bugs .

When the test fails we need to take screenshot.
TestNG has  intelligence , it will direct code to Listeners.
Create Listeners class

//ITestListener interface which implements TestNG Listeners
public class Listerners implements ITestListener{
}

Add unimplemented methods which TestNG exposes.

Listeners - > Listens to our testcase

on failure :
//take screenshot
//print response.

On success :
successfully executed - listeners pass code 

We need to configure xml , where listeners are located.
else it wont run


create new xml as well

Add listener after suite name.
packagename.listeners.

Run test ng.

Put something in failure code 
it won't publish message 

<suite name="TestNG Parameters Suite" parallel = "tests" thread-count = "2" >
   <test name="Params">
      <parameter name="val1" value="2" />
